/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> arenas in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" title="Northeastern United States">Northeastern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" title="Midwestern United States">Midwestern United States</a> and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ontario, Canada, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Huskies" title="Toronto Huskies">Toronto Huskies</a> hosted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks" title="New York Knicks">New York Knickerbockers</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Gardens" title="Maple Leaf Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-firstgame-10">[10]</a> The first basket was made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossie_Schectman" title="Ossie Schectman">Ossie Schectman</a> of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_League_(1925%E2%80%9355)" title="American Basketball League (1925–55)">American Basketball League</a> (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Globetrotters" title="Harlem Globetrotters">Harlem Globetrotters</a>. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Bullets_(1944%E2%80%9354)" title="Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)">Baltimore Bullets</a> moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Lakers" title="Minneapolis Lakers">Minneapolis Lakers</a> won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-encyc-11">[11]</a></p>
    <p>On August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teams–Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo–merged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Podoloff" title="Maurice Podoloff">Maurice Podoloff</a> as president.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-encyc-11">[11]</a> To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-12">[12]</a></p>
    <p>The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#cite_note-history-13">[13]</a> as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal" title="Arsenal">armories</a>. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1954–55, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Warriors" title="Philadelphia Warriors">Philadelphia Warriors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Lakers" title="Minneapolis Lakers">Minneapolis Lakers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Royals" title="Rochester Royals">Rochester Royals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Wayne_Pistons" title="Fort Wayne Pistons">Fort Wayne Pistons</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Hawks" title="Milwaukee Hawks">Milwaukee Hawks</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Nationals" title="Syracuse Nationals">Syracuse Nationals</a>, all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks had shifted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_Cities" title="Quad Cities">Tri-Cities</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> in 1951, and later shifted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis" title="St. Louis">St. Louis</a> in 1955.
